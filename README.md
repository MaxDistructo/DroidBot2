# droidbot2
## A remake of the original DroidBot but in java instead of python.

The whole reason for remaking DroidBot was to get a bot that could do a channel by channel perms instead of just an all or nothing.
The second reason for this project is to get a bot into a language I understood instead of Python which I have much less knowledge on how to code in.

## Branch Info:

This is the Java 9 branch of DroidBot2. For cross compatability reasons, new changes will still be pushed to the master branch developed in Java 8 till Java 9 has full support from all dependencies at which time the Java 9 branch will become the master branch.
